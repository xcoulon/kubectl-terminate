= kubectl-terminate

Sometimes, you may find yourself with a namespace stuck in `Terminating` phase because one of its resource has a finalizer, but the operator (or controller) in charge of dealing with this resource is already gone (maybe it was uninstalled just before, for example). This is quite annoying and all `--force`, `grace-period` flags won't help. The only way to get rid of the resource is to PATCH it to remove the finalizers, then delete it. Doing it with a good old `curl` command is possible, but let's face it, it's a cumbersome ðŸ˜¬

Say hello to `kubectl-terminate` ðŸ‘‹ 

This command takes care of removing the finalizers and deleting on your behalf, using the KUBECONFIG settings of your choice (default location in `$HOME`, via the `KUBECONFIG` env var with the `--kubeconfig` flag). 

And as its name is in the `kubectl-*` format, it also works as an extension to `kubectl` and `oc` (for the OpenShift users). Just make sure that the binary in your $PATH and use it with `kubectl terminate pod/foo` or `oc terminate pod/foo` ðŸŽ‰

== Installation

For now, just run `go install github.com/xcoulon/kubectl-terminate` and make sure that `$GOPAH/bin` is in your `$PATH` or move manually in a valid directory.
