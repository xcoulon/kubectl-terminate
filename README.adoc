= kubectl-terminate

Sometimes you may find yourself with a namespace stuck in `Terminating` phase because one of its resource has a finalizer, but the operator (or controller) in charge of dealing with this finalizer is already gone (maybe it was uninstalled, for example). This is quite annoying and all the `--force`, `grace-period`, etc. flags won't help. The only way to get rid of the resource is to PATCH it to remove the finalizers, then delete it. Doing it with a good old `curl` command is possible, but let's face it, it's a bit cumbersome ðŸ˜¬

Say hello to `kubectl-terminate` ðŸ‘‹ 

This command takes care of removing the finalizers and deleting the resource on your behalf, using the KUBECONFIG settings of your choice (default location in `$HOME` or via the `KUBECONFIG` env var with the `--kubeconfig` flag). 

And as its name follows the `kubectl-*` pattern, it also works as an extension to `kubectl` and `oc` (for the OpenShift 4 users). Just make sure that the binary in your $PATH and use it with `kubectl terminate pod/cheesecake` or `oc terminate pod/cheesecake` ðŸŽ‰

== Installation

For now, run `go install github.com/xcoulon/kubectl-terminate` and make sure that `$GOPAH/bin` is in your `$PATH` or move manually in a valid directory.
