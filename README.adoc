WARNING:: Use at your own risk!

Sometimes you may find yourself with a namespace stuck in `Terminating` phase because one of its resource has a finalizer, but the operator (or controller) in charge of dealing with this finalizer is already gone (for example, it has been uninstalled). This is quite annoying and all the `--force`, `grace-period`, etc. flags won't help. The only way to get rid of the resource is to PATCH it to remove the finalizers, then delete it. Doing it with a good old `curl` command is possible, but let's admit it, it's a bit cumbersome ðŸ˜¬

Say hello to `kubectl-terminate` ðŸ‘‹ 

This command takes care of removing the finalizers and deleting the resource on your behalf, using the connection settings of your choice, i.e, using the `KUBECONFIG` env var if it exists, the `--kubeconfig` flag if specified or the default location (`$HOME` on Linux and macOS and `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows). 

And since its name follows the `kubectl-*` pattern, it also works as a plugin for `kubectl` and `oc` (for OpenShift 4 users). Just make sure that the binary is in your `$PATH` and use it with `kubectl terminate pod/cheesecake` or `oc terminate pod/cheesecake` ðŸŽ‰

== Installation

- run `go install github.com/xcoulon/kubectl-terminate/cmd` and add `$GOPAH/bin` to `$PATH` or move `$GOPAtH/bin/kubectl-terminate` in one of the directories of `$PATH`
- clone this repository, run `make install` and add `$GOPAH/bin` to `$PATH` or move `$GOPAtH/bin/kubectl-terminate` in one of the directories of `$PATH`

== Demo

On your own Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, you can try it with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
# create 2 pods called `keep-me` and `delete-me` that doesn't do anything
$ kubectl run --image radial/busyboxplus --restart=Never keep-me -- sleep 3600
pod/delete-me created

$ kubectl run --image radial/busyboxplus --restart=Never delete-me -- sleep 3600
pod/delete-me created

# patch the `delete-me` pod by adding a custom finalizer
$ kubectl patch pod/delete-me -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":["demo/block-me"]}}'
pod/delete-me patched

# try to delete it with the regular `delete` command
$ kubectl delete pod/delete-me
pod "delete-me" deleted
^C

# ... but the command blocks and the pod still exists
$ kubectl get pods
NAME        READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
delete-me   0/1     Terminating   0          51s
keep-me     1/1     Running       0          54s

# delete it with the `terminate` command
$ kubectl terminate pod/delete-me
pod "delete-me" terminated

# verify 
$ kubectl get pods   
NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
keep-me   1/1     Running   0          82s
